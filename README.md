This is an essential manual on how you can use the basic GitHub functionalities to manage the projects. To use GitHub for management (without pushing or pulling the codes), you do not have to install anything on your computer, including Git. Everything can be proceeded in your browser. Please feel free to add any additional contents to enrich the scope of this manual.

## Functionalities and concepts:  
#### Organization and Team
*Organization* is the largest unit to store the documents and functionalities of our projects. An organization is different from a normal personal account. It can contain several *teams*. Specific details about *organizations* and *teams* can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations).
#### Repository
Each team can contain several *repositories*. A repository is where we store the text documents of the projects (c++, python, markdown, txt, tex, ...). Typically, we create a repository for each manuscript/demonstration/presentation. Also, we have a ‘General’ repository for miscellaneous tasks that are not specifically associated with a single manuscript. Note that we only store codes and text files on the repositories. The Latex manuscript is in Overleaf and the binary files (pictures, videos, small datasets) are stored in Onedrive (UBC account).  
#### Code
Under each repository, in the menu bar, you will see ‘Code’ where you can manage the codes. Note that we only store text files here (c++, python, markdown, txt, tex, ...), but not binary files (datasets, figures, videos, MS Office documents, Simulink models, ...). The latter should be stored in the big storage, such as Onedrive using your UBC accounts. Also, 'Codes' can not only be the coding files, but also be management documents written in the listed format.
#### Issue 
Under each repository, in the menu bar, you will see ‘Issues’ where you can create issues. Issue is something you use to assign task to someone. Click ‘New issue’ to assign a task to yourself or others. Please remember to choose the assignees, the labels, the associated projects, and the concerned milestones. You can use ‘@’ to refer to someone or use ‘-[]’ to add tick boxes. Please feel free to assign tasks using issues. Also, remember to timely check the issues assigned to you and resolve them. Once you resolve a issue (finish a task), close the issue. For the offcial tutorials on issues, pclick [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues).
#### Project (board)
Under each repository, in the menu bar, you will see ‘Projects’ where you can view our project boards. A project board is where you can see the ‘to do’ and done lists. All open issues will be automatically added to the ‘To do’ column of a project and all closed issues to the ‘Done’ column. In our AIARA management, we only use ‘Projects’ to view our progress. Please try to not edit the them. For details about the project (boards), refer to [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards).  
#### (Issue) labels
Under the ‘Issues’ label, you can view the defined labels. We use label to assign the priority of each issue. Currently, we have three labels:  
- **Urgent Requests** are tasks that need to be accomplished as soon as possible.
- **Regular Tasks** are the scheduled tasks that are accomplished according to the regulated milestones.
- **Raw Proposals** are the rough tasks for a long horizon without concrete details.
Please feel free to add new labels.  
#### Milestones 
Under the ‘Issues’ label, you can view the defined milestones. A milestone is a defined event that marks a subgoal. Please remember to assign a milestone when you create an issue. In 'Milestones', you can view the progress of all milestones. A milestone is achieved (100%) when all its associated issues are resolved.

## Quick Start
Here is a quick guidance how you can start using GitHub to manage our projects.
#### For Lab Managers  
- **View the progress**: switch to the organization mode, select a team, enter the repository of a specific project, click 'Issues', click 'Milestones', and check the milestones.
- **View the status**: switch to the organization mode, select a team, enter the repository of a specific project, click 'Projects', select the desired project board, and ckeck the finished and unfinished issues.
- **Assign a task**: switch to the organization mode, select a team, enter the repository of a specific project, click 'Issues', click 'New issue', and assign the task by filling the form.  
#### For Team Leaders
- **View the progress**: enter your team, select the repository of a specific project, click 'Issues', click 'Milestones', and check the milestones.
- **View the status**: enter your team, select the repository of a specific project, click 'Projects', select the desired project board, and ckeck the finished and unfinished issues.
- **Assign a task**: enter your team, select the repository of a specific project, click 'Issues', click 'New issue', and assign the task by filling the form.  
- **Finish a task**: enter your team, select the repository of a specific project, click 'Issues', check the issues assigned to you, and close the issue when you finish it.
#### For Team Members
- **View the status**: enter your team, select the repository of a specific project, click 'Projects', select the desired project board, and ckeck the finished and unfinished issues.
- **Assign a task**: enter your team, select the repository of a specific project, click 'Issues', click 'New issue', and assign the task by filling the form.  
- **Finish a task**: enter your team, select the repository of a specific project, click 'Issues', check the issues assigned to you, and close the issue when you finish it.
